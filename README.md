# Server-Client-Traffic-Light-System

This repository contains a Java implementation of a Traffic Light system, which simulates a pedestrian crossing system using a client-server architecture. The system includes components for controlling traffic lights and pedestrian signals, with clients interacting to trigger crossing sequences and report panel statuses.

# Features
- Client-Server Architecture: The system is built on a client-server model. The server controls the traffic lights and pedestrian signals, while clients represent panels and interact with the system.

- Traffic Light Crossing Logic: The system adheres to the specifications of a Pelican Crossing, with accurate state transitions for traffic lights and pedestrian signals during crossing sequences.

- User Interaction: Clients provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the crossing system. Users can trigger crossing sequences, check the panel status, and gracefully exit the client application.

# Concepts Used
 -  Client-Server Architecture
 - Sockets 
 - Multi-Threading
 - State Management
